            When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML
            file, they use inline CSS.
          </li>
          <li>
            The internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the
            head section of the HTML file.
          </li>
          <li>
            External CSS style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS
            rules in a separate file.
          </li>
          <li>
            When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link
            element placed in the HTML's head.
          </li>
          <li>
            A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an
            element.
          </li>
          <li>
            A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside
            an element.
          </li>
          <li>
            To apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page we use *.

          <li>
            The display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns
            each image to start on a new line.
          </li>
          <li>
            Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we
            choose.

        <ul>
          <li>
            A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our
            code.
          </li>
          <li>
            To declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var
            keyword, we give the variable a name.
          </li>
          <li>
            We use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we
            want stored in our variable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a
            script.
          </li>
          <li>
            In Javascript, there are five basic, or primitive, types of data:
            strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null.
          </li>
          <li>Each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon.</li>
          <li>
            Use the console.log method to output a message to the web console by
            adding an argument.
          </li>
          <li>
            The order of code affects the outcome. JavaScript is read from top
            to bottom.
          </li>
          <li>
            A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0,
            -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the
            value of false.
          </li>
          <li>We can have more than one condition by using else if.</li>
          <li>
            The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are
            equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and
            false if the values are not equal.
          </li>
          <li>
            An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data
            related in some way.
          </li>
          <li>
            To work with individual data items inside an array, we need to have
            the location of the data item in the array (an index).
          </li>
          <li>Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential.</li>
          <li>
            For loop is a control flow statement for specifying iteration.
          </li>
          <li>
            For loop contains three important statements: starting point,
            length, what allows the array to iterate over each item.
          </li>
          <li>
            A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to
            perform a certain task.
